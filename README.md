# Zurmo CRM

Download and run:  
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllGray/CRM/master/zurmo-chip-crm.sh  
sudo chmod +x zurmo-chip-crm.sh  
sudo ./zurmo-chip-crm.sh

After the script is done, head over to your.loacal.ip.address/zurmo  
You should see the CRM system running, and a button you can press to "Click to Start"  
  
  
The next screen is a system CHECK that you should pass with flying colours  
At this point you should be on the configuration screen. Don't worry. The script took care of most of this.  
Note. It is important that the Database Username Is set as root and the Database Password is matching the password you gave the script at the start of the install process.  

  
The Super User Password you can choose for yourself, and will be the password you log in with in a minute.  
  
From now it's just a question about pressing "install" and that is that.   
  
Log in with:  
user: Super (you can change this later)  
pass: The Super User Password you set above  
  
Enjoy your fully functioning CRM system on a $9 CHIP
